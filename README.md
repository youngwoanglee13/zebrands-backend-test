# Product Catalog - ZeBrands Project
This project implements a basic catalog system to manage products. It allows administrators to create, update, and delete products, as well as manage other administrators. Additionally, anonymous users can retrieve information about products without the ability to make changes.

## Key Features
- Product management with SKU, name, price, and brand.
- Two types of users: administrators and anonymous users.
- Notifications to administrators when changes are made to products.
- Tracking the number of product queries made by anonymous users.

## Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-JWT-Extended
- Flask-Mail (Gmail)
- MySQL
- Docker

## Project Structure
The current architecture is a monolithic design, structured as a single unit with MVC pattern implementation. This allows for the implementation of some functionalities in the future, but if multiple functionalities are desired, it is recommended to use a microservices-based architecture.

- `app/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `controllers/`: Business logic controllers.
  - `database/`: Database configuration.
  - `models/`: Data model definitions.
  - `routes/`: Application routes.
  - `schemas/`: Data schemas for serialization.
